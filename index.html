                <p>Contrary to popular belief, <strong>Ipsum </strong> is not simply random <em>text.</em> It has roots
                    in a piece of classical
                    Latin literature from
                    45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney
                    College in
                    Virginia, looked up
                    one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the
                    cites of the word in
                    classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and
                    1.10.33 of "de Finibus
                    Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a
                    treatise
                    on the theory of ethics,
                    very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..",
                    comes from a line in section
                    1.10.32.
                    <br>

                    The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested.
                    Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from
                    "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form,
                    accompanied
                    by English versions from
                    the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
